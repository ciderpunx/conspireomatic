# conspireomatic
An Haskell program to generate an RSS feed of conspiracy theories to feed to a twitterbot. 

I can't use Twitter's own API because of their decision not to let me publish to it unless I own a mobile phone.

These conspiracies may or may not be true.

Remember: **the truth is out there**
